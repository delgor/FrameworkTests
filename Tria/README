This directory contains a unit-test for Tria. As this is a tool, we don't parse
the output ourself. Instead, we let tria generate code out of a header
("tst_header.hpp") and then use Nuria::MetaObject in tst_<name>.cpp to examine
the results, verifying them.

As all features are tightly packed into Tria, it doesn't make too much sense
at the moment to split tests into smaller chunks.
